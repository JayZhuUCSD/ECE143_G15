    "Hi, Josh. This notebook is for you to create one image of all_ratio vs different genres, which tries to find the distribution of all_ratio values over different genres. I provide with you five DataFrame, namely df_action, df_adventure, df_indie, df_casual and df_strategy, so there are in total five labels. You can just run my codes and you will see how these DataFrames look like.\n",
